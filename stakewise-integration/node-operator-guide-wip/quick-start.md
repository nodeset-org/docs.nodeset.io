## Enabling the StakeWise Module

StakeWise support is currently **open to all registered node operators**. There is no permissions gate to use it.

Open the config UI with `hyperdrive service config`, navigate to the `Modules` section, and open the `StakeWise` module. Check it to enable it, then save and exit. You will be prompted to restart your services in order to launch the StakeWise module.
