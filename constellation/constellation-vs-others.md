## Constellation vs Running a Node

Most xrETH depositors can expect similar returns and lower risks compared to running a basic Ethereum node (AKA "solo staking") on your own. In addition, xrETH is a liquid token, which allows for its usage in DeFi, boosting its potential even further.&#x20;

When comparing to other node operation options, the landscape is more complex. Generally speaking, using xrETH as a Constellation Node Operator allows for improved returns and full liquidity, and other solutions are available for users wishing to purely maximize returns even at the cost of liquidity or utility.
