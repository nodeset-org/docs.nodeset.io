## Constellation vs Running a Node

Most xrETH depositors can expect similar returns and lower risks compared to running a basic Ethereum node (AKA "solo staking") on your own. In addition, xrETH is a liquid token, which allows for its usage in DeFi, boosting its potential even further.

When comparing against a system like Rocket Pool or Lido CSM, however, the comparison becomes more complex.

| Method | Pros | Cons |
| ------ | ---- | ---- |
| xrETH  |      |      |
|        |      |      |
|        |      |      |
