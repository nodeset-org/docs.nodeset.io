# Node Operator Guide

## **Quick Start**

If you already have a Hyperdrive node that is registered with NodeSet, these commands will register your node with Constellation and create a new minipool:

`hyperdrive cs n r`&#x20;

`hyperdrive cs minipool create`

***

For more in-depth information on how to interact with Constellation using Hyperdrive, see the other pages in this guide.
