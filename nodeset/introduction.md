### NodeSet is a Collective of Hundreds of Professional Node Operators

For protocols, DAOs, and investors, NodeSet keeps your assets safe and productive -- while you retain full ownership and custody.

For operators, NodeSet connects you to new opportunities to earn at no cost to you.

***

Decentralized and distributed node operators are the fundamental force which ensures safety and credible neutrality of digital value transfer. We develop the relationships and tooling needed to help this decentralized river of value continue to flow effectively.

### Active Node Operator Management

NodeSet is a **managed-distributed infrastructure aggregator**. This unique approach merges the effective resilience of decentralization with the quality and support of centralization.&#x20;

All NodeSet infrastructure services are non-custodial! This means that neither NodeSet nor participating operators have access to assets, and all assets remain under the custody of users.



| Type                             | Philosophy                                                                                                                     | Example     |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| Managed-Distributed              | Partial operator independence is preserved, which allows for limited errors. Neither performance nor resilience is sacrificed. | NodeSet     |
| Permissionless and Decentralized | Full operator independence is preserved, which allows for unchecked errors. Sacrifices performance for resilience.             | Rocket Pool |
| Fully Centralized                | No operator independence allowed. Errors are catastrophic when encountered, yet performance is generally high.                 | Lido        |
